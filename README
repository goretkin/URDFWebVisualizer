This project has some deps. Some of those deps appear to be on npmjs, but the version is incompatible, or unmaintained or whatever. So a copy of the deps is in vendor. Ideally, we should get the project working with modern THREE, and modern packages on npmjs.

In some cases, only the build product is included. In others, there's a repo, in which case that has to be built itself.
For example vendor/ros3djs has been modified so that it loads its dependencies in a CommonJS way (as opposed to expecting them to be defined globally). Note that this CommonJS way doesn't make any sense to the ros3djs project. It only works when its build file is concatenated by webpack in the main project.
To build it ros3djs: 
$ cd vendor/ros3djs/; grunt build; cd -;

To build the main project:
$ yarn run build-for-dev

This project has some deps. Some of those deps appear to be on npmjs, but the version is incompatible, or unmaintained or whatever. So a copy of the deps is in `vendor`. Ideally, we should get the project working with modern THREE, and modern packages on npmjs.

Some deps are repos (via git submodules). To get these, do
``$ git submodule init; git submodule update`

Then we need to build those JS projects:
`$ cd vendor/ros3djs/; npm install; cd -;`
`$ cd vendor/ros3djs/; grunt build; cd -;`
`$ cd vendor/roslibjs/; npm install; cd -;`
`$ cd vendor/roslibjs/; grunt build; cd -;`

To build the main project:
`$ npm install`
`$ yarn run build-for-dev`
